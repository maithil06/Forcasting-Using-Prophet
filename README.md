## Overview
This notebook provides a practical example of implementing time series forecasting using the `fbprophet` library. It's designed to be a straightforward guide for beginners and a quick reference for those familiar with time series analysis.

## Key Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Demonstrates how to load data from a CSV file and prepare it for Prophet, including date conversion and renaming columns.
- **Prophet Model Implementation**: Shows the steps to initialize, fit, and predict with a Prophet model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Visualizes the forecast and its components (trend, weekly, yearly seasonality).
- **Scalability**: Includes a "Bonus Round" section that illustrates how to apply the forecasting model to multiple time series efficiently.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run this notebook:
- `pandas`
- `fbprophet`

You can install `fbprophet` using pip:
```bash
!pip install fbprophet
